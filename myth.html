                <p> There was nothing in this place a while ago. But Man-hee Jung's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather x300!'s grandfather coughed and the universe was created.<br><br>
		This cough is what scientists say <em>"BIG BBANG"</em>.(isn't delicious)<br><br>
		And, by accident, the rice he ate was spilled, and celestial bodies were created, among them the sun and the earth.<br><br>
	        However, Grandpax300!+1 was a good thing to get rid of it, and suddenly he got annoyed and spit on it, and the DNA in it made our ancestor Jeong Man-hee.<br><br> 
         Finally, in the year 200*, God Man-hee Jung was born.<br><br>
    Man-hee Jung was unique from the time he was born, but from the time he was born, he said the proof of Fermat's last theorem, which is notorious for being terrifying, and he made a number of novelties such as a teleportation device and a time machine. <br><br>
		Until 2020, they went down 500km from the 9th surface of the ground, barked large houses, and lived without the knowledge of the Neolithic, Paleolithic, dinosaurs, and Joseon dynasties. But 
    In 2020, he came out to give out a vaccine due to the corona crisis. God got a job at one of the bio companies, such as Moder*, Huai*, and Astzereni*, and developed a vaccine, but no one knows which company it is.<br><br>
    The vaccine is in clinical trials and has not yet been released.<br><br>
		jungmanheehas a history of becoming smarter by teaching math to "Lee**" after going to an academy called jtwo.</p>
